# my-config-files

### Nvim
- Using Plug vim for vim package updates
- In theory the vim config should work for both an neovim config or as a regular vimrc
- I'm now using Neovim almost explicitly


### Tmux
- The OG multiplexer. I use just a custom config that's designed to work with Vim splits


### Tmuxinator
- I use this for scripting dev environment setups so I don't have to run everything by hand each time. Usually this is three parts, a log, the dev servers, and an editor


### Fish
- Fish has the best defaults of any shell and it's so easy to add and work with. I love it. Can recommend
- Also use with fish vim mode keys
